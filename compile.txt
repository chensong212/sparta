To compile the code, first read the "steps to build a SPARTA excutable:" in the Manual. Some more tips:

1) enter the "src" directory, type a command like:

make serial
 
it creates a folder named "Obj_serial" and an excutable program "spa_serial" under the "src" directory.


copy the spa_serial to the "examples/free" folder. Under the directory, type:

./spa_serial < in.free

it runs.
---------------------------------------

however, when compile the parallel program, we type:

make mpi

it failed. 

2) we enter the "MAKE" directory. copy the "Makefile.mpi" and may renamed it as  "Makefile.foo". set the key parameters as:

# compiler/linker settings
# specify flags and libraries needed for your compiler

CC =		mpicxx
CCFLAGS =	-O3
SHFLAGS =	-fPIC
DEPFLAGS =	-M

LINK =		mpicxx
LINKFLAGS =	-O
LIB =           
SIZE =		size

ARCHIVE =	ar
ARFLAGS =	-rc
SHLIBFLAGS =	-shared


MPI_INC = -I/global/mpich-3.1/include
MPI_PATH = -L/global/mpich-3.1/lib     
MPI_LIB = /global/mpich-3.1/lib/libfmpich.so /global/mpich-3.1/lib/libmpich.so /global/mpich-3.1/lib/libmpl.so

3) back to "src" folder, and type:

make foo

it works! A folder named "Obj_foo" and an excutable program "spa_foo" are created under the "src" directory.

4) copy the "spa_foo" to "examples/free" folder, and type:

mpiexec -n 4 ./spa_foo < in.free

it runs!

[NOTE: the "mpirun" may not works, just replace it to mpiexec]
